Flask-CMS demo
==============

This code base serves as a starting point to implement a Content Management System (CMS)
website where Admins can manage the menu, and Editors can manage the web pages.

Cloning the code base
---------------------
We assume that you have `git` and `virtualenvwrapper` installed.

::

    # Clone the code repository into ~/dev/my_app
    mkdir -p ~/dev
    cd ~/dev
    git clone https://github.com/lingthio/Flask-CMS-demo my_app

    # Create the 'my_app' virtual environment
    mkvirtualenv -p PATH/TO/PYTHON my_app

    # Install required Python packages
    cd ~/dev/my_app
    workon my_app
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Configuring the app
-------------------

Before we can use this application, we will have to configure the database URL and SMTP account
that will be used to access the database and to send emails.

Settings common to all environments are found in `app/settings.py`. DO NOT store any security
settings in this file as it's going to be checked into the code repository.

Environment specific settings are stored in `app/local_settings.py` that is NOT stored in the code repository.
The example `app/local_settings_example.py` can be used as a starting point::

    cd ~/dev/my_app
    cp app/local_settings_example.py app/local_settings.py

Configure `app/local_settings.py`.

Configuring the SMTP server
---------------------------

Edit ~/dev/my_app/app/env_settings.py.

Make sure to configure all the MAIL_... settings correctly.

Note: For smtp.gmail.com to work, you MUST set "Allow less secure apps" to ON in Google Accounts.
Change it in https://myaccount.google.com/security#connectedapps (near the bottom).

Initializing the Database
-------------------------
::

    # Create DB tables and populate the roles and users tables
    python manage.py init_db


Running the app
---------------
::

    # Start the Flask development web server
    python manage.py runserver

Point your web browser to http://localhost:5000/

You can make use of the following users:

- email `admin@example.com` with password `Password1`.
- email `editor@example.com` with password `Password1`.


Testing the app
---------------
::

    # Run all the automated tests in the tests/ directory
    py.test -s tests/


Generating a test coverage report
---------------------------------
::

    # Run tests and show a test coverage report
    ./runcoverage.sh      # will run py.test with coverage options

Database migrations
-------------------
::

    # Show all DB migration commands
    python manage.py db

See [the Alembic docs](alembic.readthedocs.org) for more information.


Trouble shooting
----------------
If you make changes in the Models and run into DB schema issues, delete the sqlite DB file `app/app.sqlite`.


Acknowledgements
